# CompoundInterestCalculator
This is the repository for my compound interest calculator

## Files:
CompoundInterestCalculatorBones.HTML, CompoundInterestCalculatorBrains.JS, CompoundInterestCalculatorMuscles.CSS
JS + CSS are uploaded to Weebly and HTML is copied over.

## Goal
The goal of this program is to allow employers, friends, and others to use a Compound Interest Calculator on my portfolio. No ads, simple UI, etc. 

## The process
Page is loaded. HTML renders basic features. CSS is imported to show basic visual elements. The JavaScript file is called.

The JavaScript begins by running Initialize(), which establishes the page elements. The user enters the data into the textbox. The user presses run

If incorrect format, asks to reread directions. If correct format, it runs Calculate(), which parses the data into multiple variables and runs Calculations(with variables). This determines which formula to use, runs the formula, and returns the result.
